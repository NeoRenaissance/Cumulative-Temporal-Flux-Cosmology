THE CORE CONSTANTS (The "Big Three")

$\sigma$

Name: Sigma (lowercase)

Pronunciation: "SIG-mah"

Standard Meaning: Surface charge density or Standard Deviation.

Golden Meaning: The Golden Constant. The "weight" of one second of time ($5.0 \times 10^{-44}$). This is the density of the fluid of time.

$\xi$

Name: Xi (lowercase)

Pronunciation: "Zai" (rhymes with 'eye') or "Ksee"

Standard Meaning: A random variable or correlation function.

Golden Meaning: The Sediment Constant. The rate at which mass deposits history ($1.15 \times 10^{-17}$). It defines how "thick" the Dark Matter wake is.

$\Lambda$

Name: Lambda (uppercase)

Pronunciation: "LAM-dah"

Standard Meaning: The Cosmological Constant (Dark Energy).

Golden Meaning: Cumulative Temporal Pressure. In your theory, this isn't a constant number; it's a growing variable determined by the age of the universe.

THE GEOMETRY & VARIABLES

$\rho$

Name: Rho (lowercase)

Pronunciation: "Row" (like a boat)

Standard Meaning: Density (Mass per volume).

Golden Meaning: Matter Density. Used in the Drag Equation to show that where there is matter ($\rho > 0$), there is time friction.

$\Psi$

Name: Psi (uppercase)

Pronunciation: "Sigh" (like 'sci-ence' without the 'ence')

Standard Meaning: The Quantum Wave Function.

Golden Meaning: The Potential. This represents the Future before it hits the "Present" and turns into mass.

$\mu, \nu$

Name: Mu and Nu

Pronunciation: "Mew" and "New"

Standard Meaning: Tensor Indices (The address of a number in a grid).

Golden Meaning: Coordinates. When you see $g_{\mu\nu}$ ("Gee-Mew-New"), it just means "The Shape of Spacetime."

$\lambda$

Name: Lambda (lowercase)

Pronunciation: "LAM-dah"

Standard Meaning: Wavelength or Radioactive Decay.

Golden Meaning: Sediment Decay. In your Dark Matter equation ($e^{-\lambda}$), this tells you how fast the "wake" fades away over billions of years.

$\zeta$

Name: Zeta

Pronunciation: "ZAY-tah"

Standard Meaning: Damping Ratio or Riemann Zeta Function.

Golden Meaning: Drag Coefficient. The "stickiness" of time. In a void, $\zeta = 0$.

$\Phi$

Name: Phi (uppercase)

Pronunciation: "Fye" (rhymes with 'eye')

Standard Meaning: Magnetic Flux or Gravitational Potential.

Golden Meaning: The Gravity Well. The "dip" in the fluid caused by the Sediment.

$\Omega$

Name: Omega (uppercase)

Pronunciation: "Oh-MEG-ah"

Standard Meaning: Density Parameter (The ratio of stuff in the universe).

Golden Meaning: The Maturity Index. $\Omega_\Lambda$ tells us how "grown up" the universe is based on how much expansion has accumulated.

SPECIAL SYMBOLS (NOT GREEK, BUT TRICKY)

$\nabla$

Name: Nabla (or "Del")

Pronunciation: "NAB-lah" or "Del"

Meaning: The Gradient. It asks, "How much does this change if I move?" Used in your Drag equation to calculate the "Shear" of time flow.

$\mathcal{T}$ (Calligraphic T)

Name: Script T

Pronunciation: "Big T" or "History"

Meaning: Accumulated History. This replaces the Greek letter $\tau$ (Tau) in your simplified equations ($M = \sigma \mathcal{T}$).

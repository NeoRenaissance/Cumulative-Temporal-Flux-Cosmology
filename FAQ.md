Q: "What is Dark Energy in your model?"
A: "It is the accumulated volume of the past. The universe expands to accommodate the history we create."

Q: "What is Dark Matter?"
A: "Gravitational Hysteresis. It is the wake left in the spacetime metric by mass moving through time."

Q: "Why does your theory work for galaxies but not solar systems?"
A: "Scale. The hysteresis decay constant ($\lambda$) is small. The 'wake' only becomes significant over galactic timescales ($10^9$ years), not planetary ones."

Q: "Does your theory violate the Equivalence Principle?"
A: "Locally, no. Globally, yes. That is a feature, not a bug—it explains why MOND works at large scales."

Q: "What is the physical meaning of your Golden Constant ($\sigma$)?"
A: "It is the mass-density of one second of time. It's approximately $10^{-44} \, \text{kg}/\text{m}^3\text{s}$."

Q: "Why $10^{-44}$? That seems arbitrary."
A: "It matches the Planck scale. It suggests the 'grain' of the universe is Planck-sized."

Q: "Standard cosmology says Voids are empty. You say they are fast. Why?"
A: "Zero Mass means Zero Temporal Drag. The lapse function ($d\tau/dt$) maximizes when density vanishes."

Q: "How do you solve the Vacuum Catastrophe (the 120-order magnitude error)?"
A: "I distinguish between the Reservoir (Quantum Potential) and the Flow (Realized Reality). The Golden Constant acts as the valve."

Q: "Can you prove this?"
A: "I predict a metric resonance at 6.78 MHz. If we put a resonant mass detector in a deep mine, it will ring."

Q: "Why 6.78 MHz?"
A: "It is the dimensional product of the Golden Constant and the Speed of Light squared, divided by Planck's constant. It is the vibration rate of realized history."
